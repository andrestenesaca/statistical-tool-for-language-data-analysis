# statistical-tool-for-language-data-analysis
This project involved working with a subset of the database, and doing statistical analysis to glean information from the data.

Each file labeled a specific name, ex. Letter Frequency, has a specific purpose. 

Thank you for exploring my project :)

Word Data
  Creates a database that stores each word total occurances for each year. The database is structured using dictionaries 
  in python and is easily accessible with the name of the word.

Letter Frequency 
  Computes the relative frequencies of the 26 English letters across all data in our database.

Printed Words
  A program which can compute the total number of printed words for each year using the data in our database.

Trending Words
  A program which can compute the top and bottom trending words between a given starting and ending year using the data in our database.

Word Similarity 
  A program used to compute the similaity between an inputted word and every other word in the database. The similairty algorithm was implemented with using the value of
  the cosine of the angle between vectors as the measure of similarity between two words.
